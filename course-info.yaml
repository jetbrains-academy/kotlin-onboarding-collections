title: "Kotlin Onboarding: Collections"
language: English
summary: |-
  <p>This course is designed for novices in Kotlin and focuses on working with collections in the Kotlin language. This is the third module of the course, the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21067-kotlin-onboarding--introduction">first</a> and <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21913-kotlin-onboarding-object-oriented-programming">second</a> modules can be found on JetBrains Marketplace. This module assumes that you are already familiar with all the constructs discussed in the first and second parts.</p>
  <p>Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project: step by step, by completing different small tasks, you will get a fully working project in the end. Some of the projects are practice-based and introduce to you different helpful Kotlin functions though practical exercises without much theory part.</p>
  <p><i>Note that this course does not provide a detailed explanation of such aspects as asymptotic complexity, mostly, it just describes the definitions of different types of collections and shows how to use them in Kotlin.</i></p>
  <p>All topics will be accompanied by links to <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html">the official Kotlin documentation</a>, which you can read later.</p>
  <p><i>After this course, you will be ready to use Kotlin collections in efficient ways.</i></p>
