Congratulations! You did a great job and created a functional application.
We've put together a few ideas on how you could further enhance this project on your own.
These improvements are optional and won't be assessed as part of the course.
Some of them may require changes to both the client side (what is displayed in the browser)
and the server side (the application logic).
As we don't cover client-server architecture in this course,
you can either explore it on your own or implement ideas that don't require working with third-party code.

<div class="hint" title="Click me to learn how to change the mode of the application">

To change the mode of the application and cook different recipes, go to the `GameResource.kt` file 
and modify the body of the `getCurrentTask` function. Possible values include:

- `Task.SOUP.toString()` – the tomato soup recipe
- `Task.SALAD.toString()` – the salad recipe
- `Task.SMOOTHIE.toString()` – the smoothie recipe

</div>

**Server improvements:**

- Add more types of fruits and vegetables for the recipes.
- Introduce new recipes to cook additional dishes.
- Enhance recipe logic with features like food generation, 
using more diverse ingredients, and combining actions. These changes will automatically apply to the client side.


**Client improvements:**

- Adding new types of fruits and vegetables for the recipes requires updates to both the server and client; you'll need
  to upload new images to the client and handle them accordingly.
- Adding new recipes requires updates to both the server and client; you'll need
to add more buttons and handlers to process them.
