Let's practice and add spices to our soup! In this task we will practice with sequences.
In this task we will make the `Spice` and `Taste` buttons live. 

In this task, you need to implement two functions in the `TomatoSoup.kt` file:

- `generateSpices` - which generates a _sequence_ of random spices
- `addSpices` - that accept a _sequence_ of spices, and do the following with each item from the sequence:

    - get the spice from the self (see `ShelfImpl.getSpice`)
    - put each spice into the pot (see `PotImpl.put`)

Afterward you need to _take_ a random number from 1 to 4 of spices from the sequence and perform the described actions.
